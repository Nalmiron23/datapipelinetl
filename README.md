# Data Pipeline ETL
Getting Started with Data Pipelines for ETL


Extracting Data
In this code-along, I'll focus on extracting data from flat-files. A flat file might be something like a .csv or a .json file. The two files that I'll be extracting data from are the apps_data.csv and the review_data.csv file. To do this, I'll used pandas. 

After importing pandas, read the apps_data.csv DataFrame into memory. Print the head of the DataFrame.
Similar to before, read in the DataFrame stored in the review_data.csv file. Take a look at the first few rows of this DataFrame.
Print the column names, shape, and data types of the apps DataFrame.
